As a Graduate Student at the Technical University of Munich pursuing a Master's in Communication Engineering, I have developed a strong foundation in programming skills and research publications. With a GPA of 1.6 in my B. Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Amrita School of Engineering, India, I have honed my technical skills to excel in the field of engineering.

My passion for programming has led me to complete a Crash Course on Python through Coursera and Python (Basic) on HackerRank. I have also been recognized for my technical skills with the Bravo Award from Honeywell and a Six Sigma Green Belt certification. My technical expertise includes C++, Python, and Linux, and I am proficient in using Git, Bitbucket, and Jira.

My professional experience at Honeywell Technology Solutions, where I worked full-time in Bengaluru, India, has enabled me to gain hands-on experience in software development, cyber security, and operations and maintenance. I have led a team of 3 people in O&M and played a key role as a cyber advocate for the MaxPro Intrusion Systems.

In my recent working student position at Rohde & Schwarz in Munich, Germany, I defined a data structure to describe the software component dependencies at the build and run time. I also implemented a toolset to process that dependency information, visualized dependency trees and generated the config files containing the dependency information which was used to build and deploy software components. My technical expertise in software development includes C++, Python, CMake, and Conan.

I have also gained valuable experience through research internships at Honeywell Technology Solutions, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), and Mistral Solutions in Bengaluru, India.

In addition to my academic and professional achievements, I have actively participated in extra-curricular activities, including the Amrita Live-in-Labs program, where I developed solutions to community problems. I also served as an executive member of Aavishkara, the science club in Amrita, and volunteered for the International Collegiate Programming Contest.

I am currently a recipient of the TUM Deutschlandstipendium and am excited to complete my Masters's in Communication Engineering from the Technical University of Munich in January 2025. With my strong foundation in programming skills, professional experience, research publications, and awards and certifications, I am well-equipped to take on new challenges in the field of engineering.
